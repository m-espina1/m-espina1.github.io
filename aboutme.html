  <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>Growing up an athlete, sports have always been a central aspect of my life. Being born and raised in Northern New Jersey, your sports affiliations and participation defined you, and that is always something that stuck with me. From watching Yankees game with a gap toothed smile as a young child with my father to putting down my tattered lacrosse stick for a rugby ball, if I was not watching the game, I was in it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that my career as an athlete has come to an end (thanks to a few too many scrums and sprains), my passion for communications and writing has come together with my love of the game, allowing me to stay in the game without stepping on the field. Thanks to my time at the University of Miami, I have been given several opportunities to kick start my dream. From freezing in a local hockey rink for the sake of the story to covering the Miami Hurricanes basketball team when freshman Anthony “Amp” Lawrence Jr. lead his veteran team to a victory over Notre Dame, being behind the scenes watching, reporting, and working the game from the other side of the coin has only helped me figure out exactly where I want to be for the rest of my life.
