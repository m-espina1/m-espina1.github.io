  <h3>Coach Katie Meier on family, success, and basketball</h3>
  <div id="writing">
    <p>“You see that picture over there? There’s 37. That’s just brothers, sisters, kids.”</p>
    <p>Katie Meier has always had one constant in her life: her ever-expanding family. Growing up the youngest of eight under the care of a single mother, her siblings provided her with a constant source of support, the kind that people spend their life searching for.</p>
    <p>“I just have a tremendous amount of security because there’s a lot of people that love me, and I know there’s a lot of people. I didn’t go out and earn it,” said Meier.</p>
    <p>Meier’s made quite the journey from her hometown of Wheaton, Illinois, a small-town city with a population just shy of 54,000. Her talents on the court gave her the opportunity to play with the big leagues at Duke University, the place that started her unexpected yet invaluable segue into coaching. Though she never intended on coaching those who once stood in her shoes, the change came at a highly vulnerable time for any athlete.</p>
    <p>“I ripped up my knee really, really bad. And they told me I probably wouldn’t be able to play again,” said Meier, “and if I did, I’d have a 13-16 month recovery.”</p>
    <p>With odds like that, most athletes would have turned in the towel, allowing themselves to reminisce and bask in what was as their dreams came to a screeching halt. To make matters worse, Meier and her fellow Blue Devils were riding the high of athletic success and a top 10 seat.</p>
    <p>“I was an All-American, we were eighth in the country, it was a tough time,” said Meier.</p>
    <p>For some, however, especially those with Meier’s tenacity and will, second chances come in the form of a metaphorical and intangible red shirt. Her redshirt year offered more than a chance to recover for another year as a Blue Devil. With time to get a Master’s and watch from the sidelines, Meier was able to see the game from a new perspective.</p>
    <p>“That year that I sat out, I kind of understood more of a coach’s mentality, so that was part one,” said Meier, “but, I thought all the coaches were all unhappy people, and that they didn’t have any balance. They seemed very stressed.”</p>
    <p>Though Meier was a part of the first generation of female athletes that could reap the benefits of Title IX, the times were still slow to show the progress.</p>
    <p>“The coaches that had coached through that time, you know, they didn’t have charter flights, and […] they didn’t stay in Marriots. I mean, it was just miserable. They did it because they had a great passion,” said Meier.</p>
    <p>Meier had passion, but it was still geared towards being a player rather than coaching players. She took her career to Belgium, playing professionally for a number of years. Though her reason for traveling overseas came out of the hours and efforts she put towards coming back from injury, her talent presented her with the opportunity that would ultimately start a chain reaction that brought her to Miami.</p>
    <p>“They asked me if I would coach a team, and it was like a team of like, 13 year olds, and I just loved it. I didn’t even care about my playing,” said Meier, “I mean, we [her professional team] were a EuroCup team, which means we were one of the top teams in Europe, and we were competing, at you know, really the highest level. And, I just wanted to get through my games and work on my little team.”</p>
    <p>As much as Meier loved her small team of Belgian ballers, coaching was just not Meier’s cup of tea. Upon returning to the states to work at UNC-Asheville, not far from her college playing ground, she took up a job in compliance and academics, not wanting to succumb to the difficult and demanding life of a coach. (Un)luckily for Meier, UNC-Asheville fired their Head Coach, opening up the Assistant Coach position for someone with her qualifications. It was not long before Meier could no longer deny that her place was on a basketball court. The only difference this time was that she would not be the one on the free throw line. </p>
    <p>“I lasted like nine months, and I said, ‘I need to be a coach, this is so cool. I’ve got to do it.’”, said Meier, “Two times I tried to fight it, and two times that an opportunity just happened, and a happy accident brought me back. Now, I just love it”</p>
    <p>Finding a coach, much less a person, with the authenticity and integrity that Meier possesses is rare. Though she may have never intended on coaching, it almost seems as coaching was made for Meier. Her demeanor and stoic persona on the court would give the impression of a hardened coach, her unselfish and caring nature shines through, especially when she speaks about her basketball family here at the U.</p>
    <p>“All of my players, I think, would know, the number one thing I want their families to know is there’s someone,” said Meier,” their daughter have me and they have my staff. […] we’ll be their first line of defense, we’ll protect them, we’ll take care of them.”</p>
    <p>“I can tell her anything, she can tell me anything. She’s very real, very genuine,” said senior Michelle Woods, “Even though you don’t want to hear it, she’ll tell you.”</p>
    <p>While the program’s monumental transformation and success is largely in part a result of her no-nonsense approach to coaching, Meier holds family close to her heart. Meier seems to seamlessly combine these separate elements—coaching and family—so they come together in perfect unison, creating something unique and larger than anything she had imagined when she first stepped foot in Miami. From a program that one’s boasted a losing record, Meier created a legacy, but more importantly, she created a family.</p>
    <p>"It is [a family]. It is, and it has to be. So, this is where, if there’s another way to do it, then you know, have at it,” said Meier.</p>
    <p>Meier’s family picture is a small presence in her overwhelming office, a hidden token appropriately placed across from where Meier conducts her business as the Head Coach at the University of Miami. But, it is not the sole memento of what matters most to Meier. From the blown-up portraits of stand-out memories of her time here at the U to the exclusively green and orange highlighters on the desk, Meier is constantly reminded that she has a family here in Miami, in her team, and in her staff.</p>
