  <h3>Hurricanes top Notre Dame, Lawrence makes a break-out performance</h3>

<div id="writing">
    <p>While all eyes were on veteran players Tonye Jekiri, Angel Rodriguez, and Sheldon McClellan to help lead the Hurricanes to a much-needed victory against the Irish, the leadership came from a name that is relatively new to the Miami Hurricanes basketball squad.</p>
    <p>Freshman Anthony “Amp” Lawrence Jr. surprised Canes fans with an outstanding performance that ultimately guided the team towards their 79-70 victory over Notre Dame. Despite having a 3.8 season average thus far in scoring, Lawrence managed to outscore his more experienced teammates by upwards of six points and set both a career and season high for himself of 18 points. Lawrence also managed a perfect three-point percentage for the game, going 4-4. This was only matched by Sheldon McClellan, who went 2-2 against the Irish in threes.</p>
    <p>“We can’t let one loss become two. As you can see, we didn’t let it,” said Hurricanes guard Angel Rodriguez following their home win against the Fighting Irish (15-7, Atlantic Coast Conference 6-4).</p>
    <p>The Hurricanes (17-4, ACC 6-3) had just come off a loss on Saturday against NC State, so the pressure was on for both the team and Coach Larranaga to get back into the win column. But, the Hurricanes were not just looking for an ACC win in the books. Miami and Larranaga had scores to settle with the Irish, given their losing series against the team as well as their 70-63 loss to them last March in ACC Tournament play.</p>
    <p>Following the game, Larranaga expressed his feelings on the break-through performance by the 6-foot-7 guard.</p>
    <p>“I’m very proud of Anthony Lawrence Jr. He was terrific,” said Larranaga</p>
    <p>Though a performance this good would normally stun a Division I freshman who just set a career high, Lawrence took it in stride, chuckling humbly when asked how it felt to get a roaring applause from the crowd when he stepped back out onto the court for the second half.</p>
    <p>“I was just playing the game,” said Lawrence.</p>
    <p>Miami’s defense was also crucial in their victory against Notre Dame. Senior center Tonye Jekiri lead the Hurricanes in rebounds for the game with a total of 12, the most out of any player from either team.</p>
    <p>Larranaga credits much of the team’s success tonight to their depth and ability to rely on any and all of the members of the team to perform at any given moment. Out of nine players for the Hurricanes, five players tallied double digits against the Fighting Irish. Only two of these players, McClellan and Rodriguez, were starters. The rest of the double digit scorers came from the Lawrence, who scored 18 points, Kamari Murphy, who scored 11, and Ja’Quan Newton, who managed 12.</p>
    <p>“When you go to your bench, you often have a drop off. We don’t,” said Larranaga.</p>
    <p>The Hurricanes hope to put another mark in the win column this weekend when they face-off against Georgia Tech this Sunday on the road.</p>
